# Desert-Sliding-Game

I have implemented this game using C# which is the most popular programming language for games on Windows platforms where the game will be run on. The game has been developed using the Unity game engine which is one of the top-performing game engines that is used for game development. Unity makes every gaming experience possible with tools like game assets that can be used for 3D and 2D games. C# is a powerhouse language in Unityâ€™s environment, and it is one of the main programming languages that is implemented in the Unity engine. This will include user interaction, operation, and variable assignments. The game that I have developed called Desert Sliding and it is an endless runner game where the player slides on the desert to collect coins that will be scored and counted on the top left of the screen. The player will have to jump to avoid any collision with an obstacle. If the player collides with any obstacle, he will die, and the game will over and start again. 

The below screenshots display the user interface for the desert sliding game. The first image shows the start of the game, so once the player starts sliding, he will be collecting the coins as shown in second image. The third image shows the player when he jumps to avoid a collision with an obstacle.
